                        <p class="bit">Space provides us with several unique advantages that make its exploration imperative for modern society.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> First, space allows for the “ultimate high ground,” so to speak.  This is advantageous to military operations (e.g., mapping, tracking troop movement, and surveillance) 
                        and earth observations (e.g., weather and crop monitoring).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Next, space provides us with a clear view of the universe.  For example, Space-based telescopes “see” better because their view is not impeded by Earth’s atmosphere. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Space also provides us with a “zero gravity,” or more correctly, a free-fall environment.  This type of environment has proven useful for manufacturing certain materials (i.e., metals, alloys, glasses, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and composites) because molecules line up differently when not subjected to gravity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Another advantage offered by space is an abundance of materials.  The Moon is known to host large amounts of He-3 (Helium-3) that could be useful for nuclear power plants (it is a non-radioactive isotope with non-radioactive by-products), and asteroids are teeming with precious metals and gems.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Finally, space is truly the final frontier.  By their very nature, humans seem destined to be explorers...and space beckons <strong>loudly</strong>!

                        <p class="bit">An orbit is the path in which a spacecraft travels around a planet or other celestial body.  Increasing the size of an orbit—in effect, making it 
                        “higher”—requires more energy; however, a higher orbit increases the swath width available to a payload, making the energy expenditure worthwhile.
                        </p>
                        
                        <hr class="bit-divider">
                        
                        <p class="bit">A launch vehicle often expends all of its fuel and thus, its energy, when getting a spacecraft into space.  In other words, the launch vehicle 
                        cannot always put a spacecraft into the desired orbit—it needs a little help.  After the launch vehicle has completed its job, it leaves the spacecraft in a 
                        temporary orbit where it stays until an upper stage transfers it to its mission orbit.  This temporary orbit is called a parking orbit.  Similarly, the transfer 
                        orbit is the intermediate orbit between the parking orbit and the final, mission orbit.
                        </p>
                        
                        <hr class="bit-divider">
                        
                        <p class="bit">Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to suggest that Earth was part of a heliocentric system.  However, people were very reluctant to accept his assertion.  
                        The first obstacle in gaining acceptance of his model for the universe was simply the fact that Copernicus could not prove that the Earth moved, nor could he effectively 
                        explain why Earth rotated on its own axis and revolved around the Sun.  Additionally, Copernicus’s model could not account for lack of parallax.  He argued that parallax 
                        did not occur because the stars were so far away from Earth, but the vast distances this required were too difficult for most of his critics to fathom.  As a result, his 
                        model was largely rejected.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bit">Tycho Brahe and  Johannes Kepler could easily be described as a perfect team.  Brahe was an excellent observational astronomer—he even went as far as 
                        developing a system to measure changes in his observations—but he was <i>not</i> a skilled mathematician.  Luckily, Kepler <i>was</i> a skilled mathematician.  Using Brahe’s careful 
                        observations, Kepler was able to create a model of Mars’ orbit, and for the first time, astronomers realized that the planets did not follow perfectly circular orbits.  
                        Their teamwork culminated into a scientific breakthrough of epic proportions—they <i>were</i> a perfect team!

                        <p class="bit">It’s no secret that Aristotle was a great thinker, but his thoughts on the universe were <strong>way</strong> off base.  
                        Four of Aristotle’s assertions that were thwarted by Galileo Galilei include:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> The Moon and Sun are perfect and wholly different from Earth.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Everything revolves around the Earth.

                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Objects fall at different rates, based on their weight.

                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Objects in motion only keep going if something is physically pushing them.

                        <p class="bit">Great strides were made in our understanding of the universe in the early 20th century.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Harlow Shapley was able to prove that our solar system was not at the center of our galaxy by using a velocity-distance relationship (later 
                        known as Hubble’s Law).  Doppler (or red) shift, also enabled Shapley and Edwin Hubble to demonstrate that our universe is expanding, a phenomenon likely resulting 
                        from a “Big Bang” at the beginning of time.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Albert Einstein also contributed to our changing view of the universe by developing the theory of relativity and discovering the relationship 
                        between mass and energy (i.e., E=mc2), which when combined with Henri Becquerel’s discovery of radioactivity, helped describe the inner workings of our Sun.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Space provides very lucrative opportunities for commercial companies.  One of the primary “money makers” is communications.  In today’s global 
                        society, it is imperative for people to have access to communications.  Companies who can provide services such as satellite-based cellular telephone communication, 
                        internet services, and television services rule the market (I love my DirecTV!).  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Demand for GPS services also provide companies a way to make a quick buck.  Customers interested in GPS services include farmers, those in the 
                        shipping and hauling industries, and recreational travelers.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>&middot; </strong> Moreover, in the near future, commercial companies could reap the benefits of up-and-coming technologies such as asteroid and Moon mining, space 
                        travel, and microgravity manufacturing.

                        <p class="bit">Luckily, for us, the Earth possesses an inherent mechanism that protects it from the effects of solar and cosmic charged particles.  Earth’s molten iron core 
                        creates a magnetic field.  The magnetic field lines, which are produced by this mechanism, wrap around the Earth, creating the magnetosphere.  When charged particles encounter 
                        the magnetosphere, most of them are deflected away.

                        <p class="bit">The curvature of Earth causes the surface to drop about 5 meters vertically for every 8 kilometers horizontally.  Thus, if an object attains a horizontal velocity 
                        that matches the horizontal velocity of Earth, the object’s path will follow Earth’s curvature at a constant height—it <strong>will</strong> orbit the Earth.

                        energy yields a larger-sized orbit.  Specific mechanical energy depends on the magnitude of $\bar{R}$ and $\bar{V}$ and the gravitational parameter, so the larger these values are, the larger the mechanical 
                        energy will be, and the larger the displacement (position of the spacecraft) will be over time—resulting in a larger orbit.

                        <p class="bit">Certain assumptions allow us to use a Hohmann Transfer for getting spacecraft into the correct orbit. We can use the Hohmann Transfer if we assume that the orbits are coplanar; their line of

                        <p class="bit">Sometimes when moving a spacecraft from a smaller orbit (orbit 1) to a larger orbit (orbit 2), it is necessary to use a transfer orbit in between.  To accomplish this, we change the spacecraft’s 
                        specific mechanical energy (which increases the semimajor axis of the orbit) via changes in orbital velocities.  From obit 1, we increase the spacecraft’s velocity by $\Delta V_{1}$ to gain enough energy to reach the 
                        transfer orbit.  From orbit 2 (the larger orbit) we change the velocity again by $\Delta V_{2}$ to move the spacecraft out of the transfer orbit.  Now, we have made two increases in velocity which, in turn, have changed 
                        the spacecraft’s specific mechanical energy, increasing orbit size (we’ve traded kinetic energy for potential energy).  Therefore, instead of the velocity increases resulting in a faster moving spacecraft, the 
                        $\Delta V$'s culminate into a larger semimajor axis, or a larger orbit, with a greater total energy.

                        can be used to predict the spacecraft’s range, azimuth, and elevation angles.

                        <p class="bit">Spacecraft in low-Earth orbit (particularly in orbits under an altitude of 600 km), are subject to the force of atmospheric drag.  Because drag is a non-conservative force, it causes the orbit to lose energy in the form 
                        of friction.  Since orbital energy is a function of the semimajor axis, the semimajor axis of the orbit will decrease over time due to losses from the drag force.  Additionally, this causes the orbit to become more circular, so there 
                        is also a decrease in the eccentricity of the orbit.

                        the three competing constraints (deceleration, heating, and accuracy).  If the spacecraft enters the atmosphere below the reentry corridor, or “undershoots” the corridor, it will experience too much drag resulting in overheating and 
                        slowing down.  If the spacecraft enters the atmosphere above the reentry corridor, or “overshoots” the corridor, it will experience too little drag, which will cause the spacecraft to skip off the atmosphere (like a stone skipping 
                        across water), and the spacecraft will end up back out in space instead of back on Earth.
